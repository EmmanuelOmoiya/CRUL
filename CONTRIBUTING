### Branch Organization

Submit all changes directly to the main branch. We donâ€™t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep main in good shape, with all tests passing.

Code that lands in the main must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of the main at any time.

### Prerequisites

- You have Node installed at least v12.0.0+ and Yarn at v1.2.0+.
- You are familiar with Git.

### How to Report Bugs

In order to report bugs, you should create an issue and describe the bug properly and you can also suggest a way to fix it (in case you know it). You should mention your device details (if possible) so that we can find the fix fast.
